####v0.2.0
#### A menubar app for Dribbble.

Hotshot is a simple menubar app for viewing the latest popular shots on Dribbble built with Github's Electron.

#### Installation
- Clone the repo to somewhere on your computer using `git clone git@github.com:andrewnaumann/hotshot.git`
- Navigate inside the directory using `cd hotshot`
- Install application dependencies by running `npm install`
- There is an application build script already setup inside the package.json file for Mac OSX 64bit. Execute the script by running `npm run package`
- If everything builds successfully a Hotshot-darwin-64 folder will be created with the executeable labled 'Hotshot' inside

#### Status
Hotshot is extremely barebones at the moment. At the current stage it is more of a proof of concept than a useful
application.  
Planned features include...
- The ability to like shots.
- The ability to view different feeds instead of just the top 100 popular shots.
- Anything else that I can think would be cool ðŸ‘»
